# MLSP Project 2023

Source separation of EMG signals, and estimation
of MU firing times.

## Usage

Joblib is used to cache previously done computations, and/or
parallelize workloads. 

As a result, to run the code you need a ``cache/`` folder in the top
level directory, so joblib knows where to cache computations.
